### ðŸš€ Key Features
- Multi-Engine OCR with Academic Focus: Combines EasyOCR (primary), Google Vision (fallback), and Tesseract (final fallback) with domain-specific optimizations for University and High School curriculum  
- Self-Healing & Context-Aware Processing: Features dynamic spell correction (preserves academic terms), grammar-aware reconstruction, and fuzzy matching (85% Levenshtein threshold) to handle low-quality scans and handwritten notes.
- Hybrid Classification System: Combines fine-tuned BERT models (including ensemble support) with keyword-based fallback for robust predictions.
- Dynamic Data Handling: Loads, balances, and preprocesses datasets from local and Hugging Face sources with class-weighting for fairness.
-  End-to-End Pipeline: Trains, evaluates, and saves models, with interactive inference for text/file inputs.
